### Detailed Prompt to Fix Footer Alignment Issue in Replit

I am facing an **alignment issue with the footer of my webpage**. As seen in the uploaded screenshot, the footer:

- Stretches all the way to the left and right edges of the screen, overshooting the main page/container margin.
- The columns inside the footer (Product, Resources, Company, Amazon Affiliate) are also misaligned, with the left columns touching/extending past the screen edge, and the right column content extending past the footer’s physical margin.
- The main body of the page has a clear margin on both sides, but the footer ignores these margins and is not visually aligned with the rest of the content.

#### Requirements for Correction

1. **Footer Alignment:**
    - The footer should have the **same left and right margins/padding as the main content/container** of the page.
    - All columns in the footer should be visually contained within these margins and never extend past them.
    - Ensure consistent gutter spacing inside the footer.

2. **Responsive Design:**
    - Footer must remain visually aligned and contained for all screen sizes (desktop/tablet/mobile).
    - Avoid horizontal scroll or overflow for the footer on any device.

3. **CSS Structure:**
    - Use a parent container/wrapper for the footer (e.g., `<footer><div class="footer-container">...</div></footer>`), with a fixed max-width and auto margins to center it, *matching the main page container’s CSS properties*.
    - All columns/content inside the footer must use flexbox or grid to stay aligned within this container.

4. **No Overshooting:**
    - No footer text or column content should go past the footer’s visible background or container margin, even on resize or small screens.
    - The location of social/media icons and calls-to-action should also be inside this aligned container.

#### Example CSS (to illustrate intent, not necessarily exact code):
```css
.main-container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 20px;
}

footer {
  background: #202534;
}

.footer-container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 40px 20px;
  display: flex; /* or grid */
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.footer-column {
  flex: 1;
  /* add appropriate margin or padding */
}
```

#### Additional Notes:
- Please review the attached screenshot to see the misalignment issues.
- Do not simply add padding to the footer; match the **overall page structure’s margin and width**.
- If you use Bootstrap/Tailwind etc., apply the same container settings as the main content.
- Please check on both desktop and mobile view to ensure proper alignment.

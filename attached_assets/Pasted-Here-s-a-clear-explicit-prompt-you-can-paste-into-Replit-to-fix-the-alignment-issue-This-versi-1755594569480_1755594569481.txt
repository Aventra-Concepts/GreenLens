Here’s a **clear, explicit prompt** you can paste into Replit to fix the alignment issue. This version is very specific so Replit doesn’t just return the same thing again:

# 🔧 Navigation Bar Alignment Fix (Desktop)

You are my frontend developer. Right now, the **brand name, logo, and hamburger icon** are all pushed to the extreme left/right edges of the navigation top bar. I want them moved slightly **towards the center** in the **desktop version only**.

## Requirements:

1. **Do not** remove or break responsiveness. The mobile version (with hamburger menu collapse) must stay the same.
2. On desktop widths (`min-width: 1024px` or similar breakpoint):

   * The **brand name + logo** should appear closer to the center, not stuck to the extreme left.
   * The **hamburger icon** (if visible on desktop) should also be moved inward slightly from the extreme right, aligning visually in a balanced way.
3. Use **flexbox or CSS grid** adjustments, not absolute positioning hacks.

   * Example: wrap the nav content in a container with `max-width` and `margin: auto`.
   * Apply `justify-content: space-between` or `center` as needed so the items sit balanced.
4. Ensure padding/margins are applied consistently so it looks professional and not cramped.
5. The change must affect **desktop layout only** (not mobile). Use a proper **media query** such as:

   ```css
   @media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
     /* adjustments here */
   }
   ```
6. Show me the **exact CSS/JSX/HTML changes** required (not just a description).

   * If it’s React/Next, modify the nav component accordingly.
   * If plain HTML+CSS, update the `<nav>` structure and CSS rules directly.

## Acceptance Criteria:

* On desktop: brand/logo and hamburger are **visually centered-ish**, not stuck on the edges.
* On mobile: hamburger still stays on the right edge, logo/brand still on left.
* No broken responsiveness.

👉 Would you like me to also give you the **exact CSS snippet** you can test right away (independent of Replit) so you can check alignment before asking Replit again?
